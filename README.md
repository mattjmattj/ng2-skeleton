# ng2-skeleton

A skeleton for developing Angular 2 applications (as of Angular 2.0.0 alpha30)
in TypeScript.

Inspired by https://github.com/pkozlowski-opensource/ng2-play.

You might also consider using https://github.com/mgechev/angular2-seed instead,
but for some reason I didn't like it

## How to

```
npm install -g tsd@^0.6.0 gulp
tsd install angular2 es6-promise rx rx-lite
npm install
npm start
```
